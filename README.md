# Achievements
* Finally, web-apps for COVID-19 diagnosis with [our best methodology](https://github.com/IDU-CVLab/COV19D_3rd) are deployed: <br/> 
&nbsp; - Using a single 2D grayscale medical slice [here](https://kenanmorani-covid-19deployment-pipeline-app-82q4v6.streamlit.app/)   
&nbsp; - Using a full CT scan [here](https://kenanmorani-covid-19deployment-patient-level-predictions-d37izn.streamlit.app/)
