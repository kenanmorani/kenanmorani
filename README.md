# Achievements
* Providing mobile-friendly Transformer-based solution for COVID-19 diagnosis using xxs_mobilevit.
* Extending COVID-19 solution to Common Pneumonia cases.
* Providing an accurate solution for COVID-19 detection and ranking ***fourth*** on the [leaderboard](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ATt-sqsSSaQczz-Qxj85LohwPD3T0i3W/view) [IEEE ICASSP 2023: AI-enabled Medical Image Analysis Workshop and Covid-19 Diagnosis Competition (AI-MIA-COV19D)](https://mlearn.lincoln.ac.uk/icassp-2023-ai-mia/), using a full framework.
* Finally, web-apps using streamlit for COVID-19 diagnosis with [an accurate methodology](https://github.com/IDU-CVLab/COV19D_3rd) are deployed: <br/> 
&nbsp; - Using a single 2D grayscale medical slice [here](https://kenanmorani-covid-19deployment-pipeline-app-82q4v6.streamlit.app/)   
&nbsp; - Using a full CT scan [here](https://kenanmorani-covid-19deployment-patient-level-predictions-d37izn.streamlit.app/)
* Providing a lightweight Trnasfer Learning-based solution for COVID-19 detection through [MIA-COVID-19 ECCV 2022 workshop](https://mlearn.lincoln.ac.uk/eccv-2022-ai-mia/), and the IDU-CVLab has been listed again on the [leaderboard](https://cpb-eu-w2.wpmucdn.com/blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/dist/c/6133/files/2022/07/mia_eccv_2022_leaderboard.pdf); [peer-reviwed paper](https://doi.org/10.26555/ijain.v9i3.1432)
* Providing a lightweight solution for COVID-19 diagnosis using image processing techniques and CNN modelling through [MIA-COVID-19 ICCV 2021 workshop](https://lnkd.in/eWwpPA6t) and the IDU-CVLab has been listed on the [leaderboard](https://cpb-eu-w2.wpmucdn.com/blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/dist/c/6133/files/2022/03/iccv_cov19d_leaderboard.pdf); [peer-reviwed paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/21681163.2023.2219765)
* Developing and predictive model using machine learning models and recent feature selection techniques; [peer-reviewed paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8751816).
* Comparing the main machine learning models (ANN, SVM, RF) for predicting survival of patients with cardiac failure in a case study; [peer-reviewed paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440931).
