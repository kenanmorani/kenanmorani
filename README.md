# Achievements
* Providing mobile-friendly Transformer-based solution for COVID-19 diagnosis using xxs_mobilevit.
* Extending COVID-19 solution to Common Pneumonia cases.
* Providing accurate solution for COVID-19 detection and ranking ***fourth*** on the [leaderboard](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ATt-sqsSSaQczz-Qxj85LohwPD3T0i3W/view) [IEEE ICASSP 2023: AI-enabled Medical Image Analysis Workshop and Covid-19 Diagnosis Competition (AI-MIA-COV19D)](https://mlearn.lincoln.ac.uk/icassp-2023-ai-mia/), using a full framework.
* Finally, web-apps using streamlit for COVID-19 diagnosis with [our best methodology](https://github.com/IDU-CVLab/COV19D_3rd) are deployed: <br/> 
&nbsp; - Using a single 2D grayscale medical slice [here](https://kenanmorani-covid-19deployment-pipeline-app-82q4v6.streamlit.app/)   
&nbsp; - Using a full CT scan [here](https://kenanmorani-covid-19deployment-patient-level-predictions-d37izn.streamlit.app/)
